PMR:
1. The purpose of my program was to help colleges understand what classes they need to add more professors and which classes to downsize in.
2. This could be useful in the real world for collecting data. This data can be then used for other purposes whether its predicting future events or changing staffing.
3. I ran into an issue which was that I originally wanted to manually write a csv file but then I realized that the file path would be different on my computer compared to your computer.
4. I would have found a more efficient way of using if, else if, and else at the very end of my program so that ways I wouldn't waste time copy and pasting them into a find and replace program.
5. This program can be generalized into collecting data for any other field. This can be the rates of success for medicine or the movement of the stock market.

Security:
1. Authentication is considered in my program so that ways the result that I get will be as accurate as possible and I won't make any mistake in staffing.
2. Digital Signatures are important to add additional verification to prevent hackers from logging into other people's accounts.
3. Encryption will be necessary to hide the data that I have and make sure that they aren't stolen by hackers.
