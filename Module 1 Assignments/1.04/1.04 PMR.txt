1. The purpose of this program was to inform the user about the importance of voting. It takes in their age and also informs them when can they vote.
2. This program can be useful as a political tool to get kids more interested in our political system. This way they can avoid the political chaos right now.
3. A problem I ran into was finding a way to use a case insensitive method for my if statements. I looked on stack overflow and found a solution however.
4. I wouldn't do anything much differently as I am proud of the final output.
5. This can be used any form of multiple choice test if I change a few variables.
