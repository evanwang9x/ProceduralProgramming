1. The purpose of this program was to make a program to see if someone is registered.
2. This program would be useful ijn the real world for an RSVP website. This can let users see who's going and if they had signed up.
3. I ran into an issue with reading but I fixed it when I included a second for in statement.
4. I would understand what type of information I am feeding through my if statements so I wouldn't waste time.
5. This program could be changed to see if users have made an account in a website. It can also be used to give users a specific number incase they want to reset passwords.
